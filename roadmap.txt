FIP roadmap



Objective: 

Create a dynamic portfolio gallery that fetches data from the database and populates the gallery.html page using fetchData.js

Gallery display pieces will be clickable to display it's description, category and larger display of selected piece.



Achieved through:

Connecting functions.php and index.php with connection.php linking the two files. 
Database table will be exported from php MyAdmin as a file, which will be placed within data folder inside FIP main project folder.
fetchData.js and main.js files containing back-end data to fetch selected content and populate the browser accordingly in real-time.

Stylize data in css.
Organize css into sass files accordingly.
Create variables in their own scss file.
@import all sass module files within master.scss file and compile to master.scss using.   sass --watch sass/master.scss css/master.css    creating master.css.map
