# REMOVED URL 11/08/20



This is a dynamic portfolio webpage was created for fanshawe College final integraded assignemnt level 3, 2020. 
Professional portfolio is used to display personal creation content. All visuals and imagry created by Jordan Andigo.
All photogrphy is original.

Although I am just your below average, sleep deprived student, I can ocasionally pull off some pretty neat stuff. 
Given the academic circumstances the pandemic has provided this year; I will be leaving 2020 with a professional portfolio website created entirely by moi, AND extremely poor posture - given credit to my online classroom aka my bed.
